# MAX1704X Library
Provides a simple interface for monitoring battery charge levels. Works with any device using the Maxmim MAX17043 or MAX17044 chip such as the SparkFun LiPo Fuel Gauge.

## Overview
Arduino library for the MAX17043 and MAX17044 LiPo Battery Fuel Gauge. For an example of this device on a breakout board see the [SparkFun LiPo Fuel Gauge](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10617).

This device is also available on breakout boards from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=max17043&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Amax17043). Be cautious when ordering these from unknown suppliers. I have read on various forums that some of these do not work properly. I recommend ordering from SparkFun.
